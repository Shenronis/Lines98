An endless classic game, move one ball unit each turn (Up/Down/Left/Right) to try and match a continuous line \**(continuously in
horizontal/vertical/diagonal with 5 or more)*\* of ball unit to explode the line, you get +1 point for each unit you destroy. For each successful movement, end the turn and new ball in queue will take place on the gameboard.</br></br>

## Ball Units (or balls)
### Classic Ball Units
The classic ball units (Red, Yellow, Green, Cyan, Blue, Magenta).

### Ghost Ball Unit
"*Boo! I can go pass everything, don't even try hiding*"</br>
This ball unit can go pass every other unit and \***can reveal its darkest secret**\*

### Bomb Ball Unit
This bomb will not hurt you, **but it will blow up the tiles around it by a 3x3 matrix**. They can also trigger each other (triggered in Area of Effect, no matter what color) to cause a chained explosion!

### Crate? Ball Unit
This unit is basically colorless, only a wooden create. By all mean, it can not be triggered if lined up in a continous line of crate. **BUT you can always blow it up**.

### A Cardboard box? Unit
*Definitely not a Metal Gear Solid reference.*</br>
This unit act like a normal ball unit, but it have a cardboard box covering its true identity of color! "*I wonder if I can see underneath the box*".

### Pacman
*This is definitely a reference to Pac-Man franchise.*</br>
This unit can eat (*Waka Waka*) every other unit **BUT** they don't contribute to your point! "*Why? Ask him, he ate it all.*"
